              Executive Summary
            </h4>
            <p>
              The Scams & E-crimes Commission (SEC) is a decentralized platform designed to create accountability and self-governance within the digital asset ecosystem. By leveraging community-driven reporting, verification, and incentivization mechanisms, the SEC aims to reduce the prevalence and impact of cryptocurrency scams and electronic crimes.

            <h4 className="font-bold">1. Introduction</h4>
            <p>
              1.1 <span className="font-semibold">Problem Statement</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              The cryptocurrency and digital asset space has experienced exponential growth, bringing with it an unprecedented increase in fraud, scams, and criminal activity. Traditional law enforcement agencies often lack the resources, technical expertise, or jurisdictional authority to effectively combat these crimes, leaving victims with little recourse and allowing perpetrators to continue operating with impunity.
            </p>
            <p>
              1.2 <span className="font-semibold">Solution Overview</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              The SEC provides a community-driven platform where users can report, verify, and track suspected scammers. By creating a transparent, immutable record of fraudulent activities, the SEC establishes a reputation system that follows actors across the digital landscape, making it increasingly difficult for bad actors to repeatedly victimize different communities.
            </p>
            
            <h4 className="font-bold">2. Platform Architecture</h4>
            <p>
              2.1 <span className="font-semibold">Technical Foundation</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              The SEC platform is built on a hybrid architecture that combines traditional database systems for scalability and performance with blockchain integration for authentication, verification, and immutability of critical data. This approach allows for a user-friendly experience while maintaining the transparency and trustlessness necessary for a community-governed system.

            <p>
              3.1. <span className="font-semibold">High Risk:</span> Cryptocurrencies and digital assets are highly volatile and speculative. 
              The value of cryptocurrencies can drastically fluctuate and potentially drop to zero. Never invest funds that you cannot afford to lose.

            <p>
              3.2. <span className="font-semibold">Regulatory Uncertainty:</span> The regulatory status of cryptocurrencies varies by jurisdiction and is subject to change.

            <p>
              3.3. <span className="font-semibold">Tax Implications:</span> Cryptocurrency transactions may have tax consequences.
